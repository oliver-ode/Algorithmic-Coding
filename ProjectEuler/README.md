# Project Euler
These are my project Euler solutions. I will try to do them all in C++, but if they deal with massive numbers or strings I will most likely do it in Python.

## C++ header
I have a c++ header file that contains code that I re-use. For example includes of standard libraries, typdef to uint64_t and prime functions.

### These are the current ones that I have skipped:
Problem 26 - I don't want to just do the solution in python and cheese it. I want to figure out a smarter way to do it
