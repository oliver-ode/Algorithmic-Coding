# Algorithmic-Coding
This repository has lots of my solutions for the CCC and other algorithmic coding problems. The solutions will be in Python 3 or Java. More of the solutions coming out will be in Java as I have transitioned languages.

A directory for all of the files is in the DIRECTORY.md file. All of the questions are in QUESTIONS.md.

This has some complete and incoplete solutions for several different algorithmic challenges as listed below:
- CCC
  - [Competition Info](http://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html)
  - [Problems](https://dmoj.ca/problems/?category=4)
- [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) (Nothing added yet but will)
- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (Nothing added yet but will)
  
There are also several other pieces of code that are in here:
- Conways game of life (Not added yet but will)
