# Algorithmic-Coding
This repository has lots of my solutions for the CCC and other algorithmic coding problems. The solutions will be in Python 3, Java or C++. Any new solutions being added (only Project Euler atm) will most likely be in C++, but some things are just easier for me to do in Python.

This has some complete and incomplete solutions for several different algorithmic challenges as listed below:
- CCC
  - [Competition Info](http://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html)
  - [Problems](https://dmoj.ca/problems/?category=4)
- [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)
