# Algorithmic-Coding
This repository has lots of my solutions for the CCC and other algorithmic coding problems. The solutions will be in Python 3, Java or C++. More of the solutions coming out will be in Java as I have transitioned languages (from Python). C++ is the language that I want to transition into, but at the moment it is used rarely.

This has some complete and incomplete solutions for several different algorithmic challenges as listed below:
- CCC
  - [Competition Info](http://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html)
  - [Problems](https://dmoj.ca/problems/?category=4)
- [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) (Nothing added yet but will)
- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (Nothing added yet but will)
