# Algorithmic-Coding
This repository has lots of my solutions for the CCC and other algorithmic coding problems. The solutions will be in Python 3 or Java. More of the solutions coming out will be in Java as I have transitioned languages.

A directory for all of the files is in the DIRECTORY.md file.

This has some complete and incoplete solutions for several different algorithmic challenges as listed below:
- CCC

- Project Euler (Nothing added yet but will)
